#+STARTUP: overview
#+TITLE: Dominik's Emacs
#+CREATOR: Dominik 'dgr' Riva
#+LANGUAGE: en
#+OPTIONS: num:nil
* Installation
** Quick Installation
=git clone https://github.com/slalomsk8er/UncleDomsEmacs ~/.emacs.d=

Keep in mind that you should remove your own ~/.emacs and your ~/.emacs.d
prior to cloning this configuration. The next time you launch Emacs (and I recommend
launching emacs in the tty for the first time) it's going to download a good amount
of packages and configure them for you, you might see warnings and errors being
displayed as well, those are safe to ignore as long as you relaunch emacs and
see none.

The configuration, much like emacs is self documented, I highly recommend reading
through my ramblings in their entirety.

** Less Quick Installation
You are free to pick out bits and pieces of this and apply them.
So long as you have a working =use-package= configuration (take a peek at my init.el),
there should be absolutely no issues.
I highly encourage you to read up on the prose around the packages you are interested in,
I do my absolute best to describe the configuration as well as I only can, this might help you on your emacs journey!
Have some fun with it, add your own keybindings, change parameters, it's your editor in the end.

* Dependencies for:
** EXWM
Since we are going to use emacs as our window manager, it would be nice to have some external software to make our life easier.
*** From the package manager:
- =xorg-server=, for obvious reasons. (there is no wayland support as of now)
- =pulsemixer=, available from =https://github.com/GeorgeFilipkin/pulsemixer=.
- =imagemagick=, if you are going to be using emacs to take screenshots.
- =ibus-daemon=, if you need multiple keyboard input options (emacs handles them well on its own but ibus is nice).
- =terminus-font=, for it to work out of the box, if you don't want terminus you need to edit your =init.el=.
- =fonts-firacode= ,font with ligatures for coders
- =texlive= and =texlive-fonts-extra=, working in TeXlive for PDF exports with Org

**** Optional
- A browser (sadly, the built in xwidgets-webkit thingie is unreliable).
- A composite manager (highly recommended, I personally use =compton=, the built in one does not work as intended.).
- =noto-cjk=, for all the fonts imaginable.
- =slock=, if you would like to lock the screen.

** TRAMP
*** From the package manager:
- =sudo=, properly configured for your user.

** EMMS
*** From the package manager:
- =mpd=, since we are going to be using EMMS for music playback, I recommend setting up a working mpd server.
- =mpv=, for video playback.

* Some notes
** On use-package some more
We utilize use-package to handle downloading and configuring other packages painlessly.
With =init.el= written the way it is, emacs checks for the presence of =use-package=
on launch and downloads it and installs if necessary.
=el-Get= is too old and not configurable enough.

** On the format of the configuration
As you may have noticed, as you scroll down my bit of prose, this is the configuration file itself.
This configuration is written in =org-mode=, which is a great emacs package and a great markup language.
On launch, this file is being sourced into =~/.emacs.d/init.el=, the prose is being automatically
stripped (as to not affect performance) and the remaining =config.el= file is parsed.

This is also the reason why your org-mode configuration file is never called =init.org=.

** On the use case of this configuration
This entire config is meant to be used as a full on desktop environment, it is tailored to sit on top of xorg and be awesome.
It is perfectly possible to use it without exwm and emms, as a regular emacs config, just make sure to delete the unwanted sections,
ex.g EXWM, Audio Control, EMMS and all the launchers.
There is barely any learning curve to using =exwm=, since it makes x-windows act as regular buffers as much as possible,
so chances are, as long as you know your way around emacs itself, you will instinctively know how to make use of its features.

** On the keybindings
I do my best to not pollute keymaps with my own keybindings. Most of the bindings I defined myself utilize the Super key (noted as =s-=).
This is the least used modifier key together with Shift (noted as =S-=), thus using those, chances are all the bindings you already know
and love are going to work flawlessly. For all the others, just keep on reading.

* Basic Interface Settings
These are setting that do not depend on packages and are built-in enhancements to the UI.
** Looks
*** Theme
I like the solarized dark theme and the one from Doom Emacs works better in diverse modes
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-themes

    :init (load-theme 'doom-solarized-dark t))
#+END_SRC
*** Fonts and Icons
To aktivate ligatures copy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mickeynp/ligature.el/master/ligature.el to a path included path for use-package to find or specify it below.

          (global-ligature-mode t))
#+END_SRC
*** Pretty symbols
Changes =lambda= to an actual symbol and a few others as well, only in the GUI version though.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system (global-prettify-symbols-mode t))
#+END_SRC
*** TODO Fringe
    Why isn't it working on reload? 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-fringe-mode 10)
#+END_SRC
*** Remove lame startup screen
We use an actual replacement for it, keep reading or head directly to =dashboard=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
#+END_SRC
*** Disable menus and scrollbars
If you like using any of those, change =-1= to =1=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC
*** Switch bell from audible to visual
I't less annoying but still gives feedback.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq visible-bell t)
#+END_SRC
*** Set UTF-8 encoding
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp 
  (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
  (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
#+END_SRC
*** Highligh current line
=hl-line= is awesome! It's not very awesome in the terminal version of emacs though, so we don't use that.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system (global-hl-line-mode t))
#+END_SRC
** Functionality
*** Disable backups and auto-saves
I don't use either, you might want to turn those from =nil= to =t= if you do.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq make-backup-files t)
(setq auto-save-default t)
#+END_SRC
*** Change yes-or-no questions into y-or-n questions
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+END_SRC

* Window Manager
Everything regarding the WM or DE-like functionality is bundled here, remove the entire section if you do not wish to use =exwm=.

** exwm
*** Installation
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package exwm
    :ensure t
    :config
      (require 'exwm-config)
      (exwm-config-default))
#+END_SRC

*** Default workspace number
I need one, and only one single workspace by default, since =exwm= is good enough to create those dynamically anyway, it doesn't matter much.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq exwm-workspace-number 1)
#+END_SRC

*** Keybindings
If you are wondering why I am not utilizing use-package for the bindings,
allow me to tell you about slight bugs that occur only when dealing with exwm bindings.
TL;DR: It destroys the entire configuration, nothing works and all hell breaks loose.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-k") 'exwm-workspace-delete)
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-w") 'exwm-workspace-swap)
#+END_SRC
*** XF86 Button for non-emacs buffers
By default, these don't work, this makes sure they do, adding them to exwm-input-prefix-keys.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (dolist (k '(XF86AudioLowerVolume
	       XF86AudioRaiseVolume
	       XF86PowerOff
	       XF86AudioMute
	       XF86AudioPlay
	       XF86AudioStop
	       XF86AudioPrev
	       XF86AudioNext
	       XF86ScreenSaver
	       XF68Back
	       XF86Forward
               Scroll_Lock
	       print))
    (cl-pushnew k exwm-input-prefix-keys))
#+END_SRC

** Launchers
Since I do not use a GUI launcher and do not have an external one like dmenu or rofi,
I figured the best way to launch my most used applications would be direct emacsy
keybindings.

*** dmenu for emacs
Who would've thought this was available, together with +ido-vertical+ it's a nice large menu
with its own cache for most launched applications.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dmenu
    :ensure t
    :bind
      ("s-SPC" . 'dmenu))
#+END_SRC

*** Functions to start processes
I guess this goes without saying but you absolutely have to change the arguments
to suit the software that you are using. What good is a launcher for discord if you don't use it at all.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun exwm-async-run (name)
    (interactive)
    (start-process name nil name))

  (defun dgr/launch-discord ()
    (interactive)
    (exwm-async-run "discord"))

  (defun dgr/launch-browser ()
    (interactive)
    (exwm-async-run "firefox"))

  (defun dgr/lock-screen ()
    (interactive)
    (exwm-async-run "slock"))

  (defun dgr/shutdown ()
    (interactive)
    (start-process "halt" nil "sudo" "halt"))
#+END_SRC

*** Keybindings to start processes
These can be modified as well, suit yourself.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "s-d") 'dgr/launch-discord)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<s-tab>") 'dgr/launch-browser)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<XF86ScreenSaver>") 'dgr/lock-screen)
  (global-set-key (kbd "<XF86PowerOff>") 'dgr/shutdown)
#+END_SRC

** Audio controls
This is a set of bindings to my XF86 keys that invokes pulsemixer with the correct parameters

*** Functions to start processes
It goes without saying that you are free to modify the modifier as you see fit, 4 is good enough for me though.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun audio/mute ()
    (interactive)
    (start-process "audio-mute" nil "pulsemixer" "--toggle-mute"))

  (defun audio/raise-volume ()
    (interactive)
    (start-process "raise-volume" nil "pulsemixer" "--change-volume" "+4"))

  (defun audio/lower-volume ()
    (interactive)
    (start-process "lower-volume" nil "pulsemixer" "--change-volume" "-4"))
#+END_SRC

*** Keybindings to start processes
You can also change those if you'd like, but I highly recommend keeping 'em the same, chances are, they will just work.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<XF86AudioMute>") 'audio/mute)
(global-set-key (kbd "<XF86AudioRaiseVolume>") 'audio/raise-volume)
(global-set-key (kbd "<XF86AudioLowerVolume>") 'audio/lower-volume)
#+END_SRC

** Screenshots
I don't need scrot to take screenshots, or shutter or whatever tools you might have. This is enough.
These won't work in the terminal version or the virtual console, obvious reasons.
If you happen to use the console terminal version of emacs, get rid of =when window-system=.

*** Screenshotting the entire screen
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dgr/take-screenshot ()
    "Takes a fullscreen screenshot of the current workspace"
    (interactive)
    (when window-system
    (cl-loop for i downfrom 3 to 1 do
          (progn
            (message (concat (number-to-string i) "..."))
            (sit-for 1)))
    (message "Cheese!")
    (sit-for 1)
    (start-process "screenshot" nil "import" "-window" "root" 
               (concat (getenv "HOME") "/" (subseq (number-to-string (float-time)) 0 10) ".png"))
    (message "Screenshot taken!")))
  (global-set-key (kbd "<print>") 'dgr/take-screenshot)
#+END_SRC

*** Screenshotting a region
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dgr/take-screenshot-region ()
    "Takes a screenshot of a region selected by the user."
    (interactive)
    (when window-system
    (call-process "import" nil nil nil ".newScreen.png")
    (call-process "convert" nil nil nil ".newScreen.png" "-shave" "1x1"
                  (concat (getenv "HOME") "/" (subseq (number-to-string (float-time)) 0 10) ".png"))
    (call-process "rm" nil nil nil ".newScreen.png")))
  (global-set-key (kbd "<Scroll_Lock>") 'dgr/take-screenshot-region)
#+END_SRC

** Default browser
I use qutebrowser, so that's what I'll set up.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-generic
        browse-url-generic-program "firefox")
#+END_SRC
* Projectile
Projectile is an awesome project manager, mostly because it recognizes directories
with a =.git= directory as projects and helps you manage them accordingly.

** Enable projectile globally
This makes sure that everything can be a project.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package projectile
    :ensure t
    :init
      (projectile-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

* Dashboard
This is your new startup screen, together with projectile it works in unison and
provides you with a quick look into your latest projects and files.
Change the welcome message to whatever string you want and
change the numbers to suit your liking, I find 5 to be enough.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package dashboard
  :ensure t
  :config
    (dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
    (setq dashboard-items '((recents  . 5)
                            (projects . 5)))
    (setq dashboard-banner-logo-title "Welcome to Dominik's Emacs!"))
#+END_SRC

* Modeline
The modeline is the heart of emacs, it offers information at all times, it's persistent
and verbose enough to gain a full understanding of modes and states you are in.


Due to the fact that we attempt to use emacs as a desktop environment replacement,
and external bar showing the time, the battery percentage and more system info would be great to have.
I have however abandoned polybar in favor of a heavily modified modeline, this offers me more space
on the screen and better integration.


One modeline-related setting that is missing and is instead placed at the bottom is =diminish=.
** Doom Mode Line
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-modeline
    :ensure t
    :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
    :custom ((doom-modeline-height 20)))
#+END_SRC

** Spaceline!
I may not use spacemacs, since I do not like evil-mode and find spacemacs incredibly bloated and slow,
however it would be stupid not to acknowledge the best parts about it, the theme and their modified powerline setup.

This enables spaceline, it looks better and works very well with my theme of choice.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;  (use-package spaceline
;    :ensure t
;    :config
;    (require 'spaceline-config)
;      (setq spaceline-buffer-encoding-abbrev-p nil)
;      (setq spaceline-line-column-p t)
;      (setq spaceline-line-p nil)
;      (setq powerline-default-separator (quote arrow))
;      (spaceline-spacemacs-theme))
#+END_SRC

** Cursor position
Show the current line and column for your cursor.
We are not going to have =relative-linum-mode= in every major mode, so this is useful.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (line-number-mode 1)
  (column-number-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Clock
If you prefer the 12hr-format, change the variable to =nil= instead of =t=.

*** Time format
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq display-time-24hr-format t)
  (setq display-time-format "%H:%M - %d %B %Y")
#+END_SRC

*** Enabling the mode
This turns on the clock globally.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (display-time-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Battery indicator
A package called =fancy-battery= will be used if we are in GUI emacs, otherwise the built in battery-mode will be used.
Fancy battery has very odd colors if used in the tty, hence us disabling it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package fancy-battery
    :ensure t
    :config
      (setq fancy-battery-show-percentage t)
      (setq battery-update-interval 15)
      (if window-system
        (fancy-battery-mode)
        (display-battery-mode)))
#+END_SRC

** System monitor
A teeny-tiny system monitor that can be enabled or disabled at runtime, useful for checking performance
with power-hungry processes in ansi-term

symon can be toggled on and off with =Super + h=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package symon
    :ensure t
    :bind
    ("s-h" . symon-mode))
#+END_SRC

* File manager
Dired is nice and all, but I find myself, very often, doing very basic operations on very few files and need something less complex.
This is where =treemacs= shines, it's not difficult to use, pops up like neotree does in vim and just works.

** treemacs
Did I mention it also support projectile projects? Yep, it's pretty rad.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package treemacs
    :ensure t
    :defer t
    :config
    (progn
      (setq treemacs-follow-after-init t
            treemacs-width 35
            treemacs-indentation 2
            treemacs-collapse-dirs (if (executable-find "python") 3 0)
            treemacs-silent-refresh nil
            treemacs-change-root-without-asking nil
            treemacs-sorting 'alphabetic-desc
            treemacs-show-hidden-files t
            treemacs-never-persist nil
            treemacs-is-never-other-window nil
            treemacs-goto-tag-strategy 'refetch-index)

      (treemacs-follow-mode t)
      (treemacs-filewatch-mode t)
      (pcase (cons (not (null (executable-find "git")))
                   (not (null (executable-find "python3"))))
        (`(t . t)
         (treemacs-git-mode 'extended))
        (`(t . _)
         (treemacs-git-mode 'simple))))
    :bind
    (:map global-map
          ([f8] . treemacs-toggle)))

  (use-package treemacs-projectile
    :defer t
    :ensure t
    :config
        (setq treemacs-header-function #'treemacs-projectile-create-header)
    :bind (:map global-map
                ([f9] . treemacs-projectile)))
#+END_SRC

* The terminal
I have used urxvt for years, and I miss it sometimes, but ansi-term is enough for most of my tasks.

** Default shell should be bash
I don't know why this is a thing, but asking me what shell to launch every single
time I open a terminal makes me want to slap babies, this gets rid of it.
This goes without saying but you can replace bash with your shell of choice.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar my-term-shell "/bin/bash")
  (defadvice ansi-term (before force-bash)
    (interactive (list my-term-shell)))
  (ad-activate 'ansi-term)
#+END_SRC

** Easy to remember keybinding
In loving memory of bspwm, Super + Enter opens a new terminal, old habits die hard.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "<s-return>") 'ansi-term)
#+END_SRC

* Moving around emacs
One of the most important things about a text editor is how efficient you manage
to be when using it, how much time do basic tasks take you and so on and so forth.
One of those tasks is moving around files and buffers, whatever you may use emacs for
you /will/ be jumping around buffers like it's serious business, the following
set of enhancements aims to make it easier.

As a great emacs user once said:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Do me the favor, do me the biggest favor, matter of fact do yourself the biggest favor and integrate those into your workflow.
#+END_QUOTE

** Ivy - Completion
a generic completion mechanism for Emacs

** scrolling and why does the screen move
I don't know to be honest, but this little bit of code makes scrolling with emacs a lot nicer.

#+END_SRC

** which-key and why I love emacs
In order to use emacs, you don't need to know how to use emacs.
It's self documenting, and coupled with this insanely useful package, it's even easier.
In short, after you start the input of a command and stop, pondering what key must follow,
it will automatically open a non-intrusive buffer at the bottom of the screen offering
you suggestions for completing the command, that's it, nothing else.

It's beautiful
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :ensure t
    :config
      (which-key-mode))
#+END_SRC

** windows,panes and why I hate other-window
Some of us have large displays, others have tiny netbook screens, but regardless of your hardware
you probably use more than 2 panes/windows at times, cycling through all of them with
=C-c o= is annoying to say the least, it's a lot of keystrokes and takes time, time you could spend doing something more productive.

*** switch-window
This magnificent package takes care of this issue.
It's unnoticeable if you have <3 panes open, but with 3 or more, upon pressing =C-x o=
you will notice how your buffers turn a solid color and each buffer is asigned a letter
(the list below shows the letters, you can modify them to suit your liking), upon pressing
a letter asigned to a window, your will be taken to said window, easy to remember, quick to use
and most importantly, it annihilates a big issue I had with emacs. An alternative is =ace-window=,
however by default it also changes the behaviour of =C-x o= even if only 2 windows are open,
this is bad, it also works less well with =exwm= for some reason.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package switch-window
  :ensure t
  :config
    (setq switch-window-input-style 'minibuffer)
    (setq switch-window-increase 4)
    (setq switch-window-threshold 2)
    (setq switch-window-shortcut-style 'qwerty)
    (setq switch-window-qwerty-shortcuts
        '("a" "s" "d" "f" "j" "k" "l" "i" "o"))
  :bind
    ([remap other-window] . switch-window))
#+END_SRC

*** Following window splits
After you split a window, your focus remains in the previous one.
This annoyed me so much I wrote these two, they take care of it.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun split-and-follow-horizontally ()
    (interactive)
    (split-window-below)
    (balance-windows)
    (other-window 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 2") 'split-and-follow-horizontally)

  (defun split-and-follow-vertically ()
    (interactive)
    (split-window-right)
    (balance-windows)
    (other-window 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 3") 'split-and-follow-vertically)
#+END_SRC
** buffers and why I hate list-buffers
Another big thing is, buffers. If you use emacs, you use buffers, everyone loves them.
Having many buffers is useful, but can be tedious to work with, let us see how we can improve it.

*** Always murder current buffer
Doing =C-x k= should kill the current buffer at all times, we have =ibuffer= for more sophisticated thing.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun kill-current-buffer ()
    "Kills the current buffer."
    (interactive)
    (kill-buffer (current-buffer)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x k") 'kill-current-buffer)
#+END_SRC

*** Kill buffers without asking for confirmation
Unless you have the muscle memory, I recommend omitting this bit, as you may lose progress for no reason when working.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq kill-buffer-query-functions (delq 'process-kill-buffer-query-function kill-buffer-query-functions))
#+END_SRC

*** Turn switch-to-buffer into ibuffer
I don't understand how ibuffer isn't the default option by now.
It's vastly superior in terms of ergonomics and functionality, you can delete buffers, rename buffer, move buffers, organize buffers etc.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x b") 'ibuffer)
#+END_SRC

**** expert-mode
If you feel like you know how ibuffer works and need not to be asked for confirmation after every serious command, enable this as follows.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq ibuffer-expert t)
#+END_SRC


*** close-all-buffers
It's one of those things where I genuinely have to wonder why there is no built in functionality for it.
Once in a blue moon I need to kill all buffers, and having ~150 of them open would mean I'd need to spend a few too many
seconds doing this than I'd like, here's a solution.

This can be invoked using =C-M-s-k=. This keybinding makes sure you don't hit it unless you really want to.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun close-all-buffers ()
    "Kill all buffers without regard for their origin."
    (interactive)
    (mapc 'kill-buffer (buffer-list)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s-k") 'close-all-buffers)
#+END_SRC

** line numbers and programming
Every now and then all of us feel the urge to be productive and write some code.
In the event that this happens, the following bit of configuration makes sure that 
we have access to relative line numbering in programming-related modes.
I highly recommend not enabling =linum-relative-mode= globally, as it messed up 
something like =ansi-term= for instance.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package linum-relative
    :ensure t
    :config
      (setq linum-relative-current-symbol "")
      (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'linum-relative-mode))
#+END_SRC
** avy and why it's the best thing in existence
Many times have I pondered how I can move around buffers even quicker.
I'm glad to say, that avy is precisely what I needed, and it's precisely what you need as well.
In short, as you invoke one of avy's functions, you will be prompted for a character
that you'd like to jump to in the /visible portion of the current buffer/.
Afterwards you will notice how all instances of said character have additional letter on top of them.
Pressing those letters, that are next to your desired character will move your cursor over there.
Admittedly, this sounds overly complicated and complex, but in reality takes a split second
and improves your life tremendously.

I like =M-s= for it, same as =C-s= is for moving by searching string, now =M-s= is moving by searching characters.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package avy
    :ensure t
    :bind
      ("M-s" . avy-goto-char))
#+END_SRC

* Text manipulation
Here I shall collect self-made functions that make editing text easier.

** Mark-Multiple
I can barely contain my joy. This extension allows you to quickly mark the next occurence of a region and edit them all at once. Wow!
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mark-multiple
    :ensure t
    :bind ("C-c q" . 'mark-next-like-this))
#+END_SRC
** Improved kill-word
Why on earth does a function called =kill-word= not .. kill a word.
It instead deletes characters from your cursors position to the end of the word,
let's make a quick fix and bind it properly.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dgr/kill-inner-word ()
    "Kills the entire word your cursor is in. Equivalent to 'ciw' in vim."
    (interactive)
    (forward-char 1)
    (backward-word)
    (kill-word 1))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c w k") 'dgr/kill-inner-word)
#+END_SRC

** Improved copy-word
And again, the same as above but we make sure to not delete the source word.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dgr/copy-whole-word ()
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (forward-char 1)
      (backward-word)
      (kill-word 1)
      (yank)))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c w c") 'dgr/copy-whole-word)
#+END_SRC

** Copy a line
Regardless of where your cursor is, this quickly copies a line.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dgr/copy-whole-line ()
    "Copies a line without regard for cursor position."
    (interactive)
    (save-excursion
      (kill-new
       (buffer-substring
        (point-at-bol)
        (point-at-eol)))))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l c") 'dgr/copy-whole-line)
#+END_SRC

** Kill a line
And this quickly deletes a line.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l k") 'kill-whole-line)
#+END_SRC

* Minor conveniences
Emacs is at it's best when it just does things for you, shows you the way, guides you so to speak.
This can be best achieved using a number of small extensions. While on their own they might not be particularly
impressive. Together they create a nice environment for you to work in.

** Visiting the configuration
Quickly edit =~/.emacs.d/config.org=
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun config-visit ()
    (interactive)
    (find-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org"))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e") 'config-visit)
#+END_SRC

** Reloading the configuration
   
Simply pressing =Control-c r= will reload this file, very handy.
You can also manually invoke =config-reload=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun config-reload ()
    "Reloads ~/.emacs.d/config.org at runtime"
    (interactive)
    (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/config.org")))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c r") 'config-reload)
#+END_SRC

** Subwords
Emacs treats camelCase strings as a single word by default, this changes said behaviour.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-subword-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

** Beacon
While changing buffers or workspaces, the first thing you do is look for your cursor.
Unless you know its position, you can not move it efficiently. Every time you change
buffers, the current position of your cursor will be briefly highlighted now.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package beacon
    :ensure t
    :config
      (beacon-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

** Rainbow
Mostly useful if you are into web development or game development.
Every time emacs encounters a hexadecimal code that resembles a color, it will automatically highlight
it in the appropriate color. This is a lot cooler than you may think.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package rainbow-mode
    :ensure t
    :init
      (rainbow-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

** Rainbow delimiters
Colors parentheses and other delimiters depending on their depth, useful for any language using them,
especially lisp.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :ensure t
    :init
      (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'rainbow-delimiters-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Expand region
A pretty simple package, takes your cursor and semantically expands the region, so words, sentences, maybe the contents of some parentheses, it's awesome, try it out.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package expand-region
    :ensure t
    :bind ("C-q" . er/expand-region))
#+END_SRC
** Hungry deletion
On the list of things I like doing, deleting big whitespaces is pretty close to the bottom.
Backspace or Delete will get rid of all whitespace until the next non-whitespace character is encountered.
You may not like it, thus disable it if you must, but it's pretty decent.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package hungry-delete
    :ensure t
    :config
      (global-hungry-delete-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Popup menu
Instead of GUI x-popup-menu, I prefer a small minibuffer, it's easier to select options this way.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ace-popup-menu
    :ensure t
    :init
      (ace-popup-menu-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

* Zapping to char
A nifty little package that kills all text between your cursor and a selected character.
A lot more useful than you might think. If you wish to include the selected character in the killed region,
change =zzz-up-to-char= into =zzz-to-char=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package zzz-to-char
    :ensure t
    :bind ("M-z" . zzz-up-to-char))
#+END_SRC

* Kill ring
There is a lot of customization to the kill ring, and while I have not used it much before,
I decided that it was time to change that.
** Maximum entries on the ring
The default is 60, I personally need more sometimes.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq kill-ring-max 100)
#+END_SRC
** popup-kill-ring
Out of all the packages I tried out, this one, being the simplest, appealed to me most.
With a simple M-y you can now browse your kill-ring like browsing autocompletion items.
C-n and C-p totally work for this.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package popup-kill-ring
    :ensure t
    :bind ("M-y" . popup-kill-ring))
#+END_SRC

* Completion
Be it for code or prose, completion is a must.

** company-mode
After messing around with =auto-completion= for a while I decided to drop it
in favor of =company=, and it turns out to have been a great decision.

*** Global mode
I like having it enabled globally myself, so thats what I do.
I set the delay for company mode to kick in to half a second, I also make sure that
it starts doing its magic after typing in only 2 characters.

I prefer =C-n= and =C-p= to move around the items, so I remap those accordingly.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :ensure t
    :config
      (setq company-dabbrev-downcase 0)
      (setq company-idle-delay 0)
      (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 3)
    :init
      (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode))

  (with-eval-after-load 'company
      (define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-n") nil)
      (define-key company-active-map (kbd "M-p") nil)
      (define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-n") #'company-select-next)
      (define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-p") #'company-select-previous))
#+END_SRC
** electric
If you write any code, you may enjoy this.
Typing the first character in a set of 2, completes the second one after your cursor.
Opening a bracket? It's closed for you already. Quoting something? It's closed for you already.

You can easily add and remove pairs yourself, have a look.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq electric-pair-pairs '(
                           (?\{ . ?\})
                           (?\( . ?\))
                           (?\[ . ?\])
                           ))
#+END_SRC

And now to enable it
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(electric-pair-mode t)
#+END_SRC

* Programming
Minor, non-completion related settings and plugins for writing code.

** python
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-jedi
    :ensure t
    :init
      (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-jedi))
#+END_SRC
** emacs-lisp
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'eldoc-mode)

  (use-package slime
    :ensure t

    (setq inferior-lisp-program "/usr/bin/sbcl")
    (setq slime-contribs '(slime-fancy)))

  (use-package slime-company

	(write-region (point-min) (point-max) file)))

    (defun rr/set-ansible-vault-mimipass-pwd ()
      "Choose which mimipass password to be used for ansible vault."
      (interactive)
      (rr/write-string (format "#!/bin/bash\nmimipass get %s"
			       (rr/helm-mimipass))
		       ansible-vault-password-file)
      (chmod ansible-vault-password-file
	     (string-to-number "700" 8))))

  (use-package company-ansible
    :ensure t
    :hook ansible-mode)

  (use-package ansible-doc
    :ensure t
    :hook ansible
    :bind
    (:map ansible-doc-module-mode-map
	  ("C-x C-s" . ignore)))
#+END_SRC
* Git integration
Countless are the times where I opened ansi-term to use =git= on something.
These times are also something that I'd prefer stay in the past, since =magit= is
great. It's easy and intuitive to use, shows its options at a keypress and much more.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq magit-push-always-verify nil)
    (setq git-commit-summary-max-length 50)
    :bind
      ("M-g" . magit-status))
#+END_SRC

* Remote editing
I have no need to directly edit files over SSH, but what I do need is a way to edit files as root.
Opening up nano in a terminal as root to play around with grubs default settings is a no-no, this solves that.

** Editing with sudo
Pretty self-explanatory, useful as hell if you use exwm.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package sudo-edit
    :ensure t
    :bind
      ("s-e" . sudo-edit))
#+END_SRC

* Org
One of the absolute greatest features of emacs is called "org-mode".
This very file has been written in org-mode, a lot of other configurations are written in org-mode, same goes for
academic papers, presentations, schedules, blogposts and guides.
Org-mode is one of the most complex things ever, lets make it a bit more usable with some basic configuration.

Those are all rather self-explanatory.

* Diminishing modes
Your modeline is sacred, and if you have a lot of modes enabled, as you will if you use this config,
you might end up with a lot of clutter there, the package =diminish= disables modes on the mode line but keeps
them running, it just prevents them from showing up and taking up space.

Edit this list as you see fit!

* Instant messaging
I like IRC, I also like other protocols but I enjoy IRC most, it's obvious that I long
for a way to do my messaging from within emacs.
There is plenty of IRC clients in the repositories, and some more in the emacs repositories
but I find that the default =erc= does the job best, it's easy to use and offers some conveniences
that more sophisticated ones don't, so I use it.

** erc, also known as "a way to ask for help on #emacs"
You might want to edit the default nick, it's password protected anyway so don't bother.

*** Some common settings
This also hides some of the channel messages to avoid cluttering the buffer.
The other line changes the prompt for each channel buffer to match the channel name,
this way you always know who you are typing to.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq erc-nick "dgr")
  (setq erc-prompt (lambda () (concat "[" (buffer-name) "]")))
  (setq erc-hide-list '("JOIN" "PART" "QUIT"))
#+END_SRC

*** Poor mans selectable server list
What it says on the tin, this changes the =erc= history to include the server I connect to often.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq erc-server-history-list '("irc.freenode.net"
                                  "localhost"))
#+END_SRC
*** Nick highlighting
You can even highlight nicks to make the buffers a bit more visually pleasing and easier to look at.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

* Media
Why bother with an external media manager when emacs is a thing.
EMMS is huge, incredibly powerful and luckily well documented.
All I need it for is to play music and video, that's it.
I also need it to display metadata on the modeline correctly, which it does with mpd automatically.

** EMMS with mpd
There is many backends, many players and codecs for EMMS, we use mpd now.

*** Basic setup for mpd
The non XF86 keys are made to be somewhat logical to follow and easy to remember.
At the bottom part of the configuration, you will notice how XF86 keys are used
by default, so unless you keyboard is broken it should work out of the box.
Obviously you might have to adjust /server-name/ and /server-port/ to fit your configuration.

*** MPC Setup
**** Setting the default port
We use non-default settings for the socket, to use the built in =mpc= functionality we need to set up a variable.
Adjust according to your setup.

*** Some more fun stuff

and only invoke it manually when needed.
